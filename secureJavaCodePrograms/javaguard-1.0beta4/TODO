General
=======

* JavaGuard is written and tested on MacOS X and Windows 2000, both having
  JDK 1.3.1 installed. Because it doesn't use any special features of 1.3.x
  it should also run under a JDK 1.2 but I haven't tested it.



To Do-List for 1.0beta5
=======================

* Logfile enhancements. So far JavaGuard only lists classes that are used in
  hardcoded references, but doesn't print the origin of such a reference.

* Speed improvements. When you specify a package, class, method or field
  pattern in the script file JavaGuard treats it as a full regular expression
  even when the term is not directly a regular expression and only denotes
  exactly one package, class etc. So far JavaGuard walks through the whole
  class tree to finally find only one element.

* Dependency checks. So far JavaGuard relies on the user when files are taken
  from local directories; only the log file will print missing classes.



To Do-List for 1.0 (final)
==========================

* Full API documentation. Currently there are still some parts which are
  either undocumented or documented only suboptimal ;-)

* Documentation and user guide how to use JavaGuard. Currently there's only
  quite few information in the README.txt file.



Post 1.0 (ideas collection)
===========================

* Pluggable API to allow custom modules influence how JavaGuard works;
  for example a Naming module that tells JavaGuard to rename classes,
  methods etc. in a special way.

* Obfuscation of constant strings.

* Better handling/special processing of Class.forName() calls.
